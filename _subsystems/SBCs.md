SBCs are used in the nEDM experiment to:

* readout over the VME bus
* communicate with [ORCA](http://orca.physics.unc.edu/)
* Communicate with the CASCADE detectors.

All SBCs run a read-only linux system (similar to the
[Raspberry Pis](Raspberry-Pis.html)) that allows them to be safely removed from
power at all times.


### Backup images

* ORCA - Active Coil Compensation/Struck readout: a backup image for this SBC is here ([Cluster server](http://10.155.59.88/_attachments/nedm%2Fsystem_health/sbc_backup_cards/sbc.2.backup.gz) ) ([Osthalle server](http://db.nedm1/_attachments/nedm%2Fsystem_health/sbc_backup_cards/sbc.2.backup.gz)).

* CASCADE detectors - A backup image for this SBC is here ([Cluster server](http://10.155.59.88/_attachments/nedm%2Fsystem_health/sbc_backup_cards/sbc.cascade.backup.gz) ) ([Osthalle server](http://db.nedm1/_attachments/nedm%2Fsystem_health/sbc_backup_cards/sbc.cascade.backup.gz)).
